		<p>Let him go! Stay on the leader! Hur&shy;ry, Luke, they’re com&shy;ing in much faster this time. I can’t hold them! Ar&shy;too, try and in&shy;crease the pow&shy;er! Hur&shy;ry up, Luke! Wait! I’m on the leader. Hang on, Ar&shy;too! Use the Force, Luke. Let go, Luke. The Force is strong with this one! Luke, trust me. His com&shy;put&shy;er’s off. Luke, you switched off your tar&shy;get&shy;ing com&shy;put&shy;er. What’s wrong? Noth&shy;ing. I’m all right. I’ve lost Ar&shy;too! You may fire when ready. I have you now.</p>
		<pre><code>print("Hello world")</code></pre>
		<p>Secure this area un&shy;til the alert is can&shy;celed. Give me reg&shy;u&shy;lar re&shy;ports. Do you know what’s go&shy;ing on? Maybe it’s an&shy;oth&shy;er drill. What was that? Oh, it’s noth&shy;ing. Don’t wor&shy;ry about it.</p>
		<p>Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! Who’s the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?</p>
		<p>He is here… Obi-Wan Keno&shy;bi! What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the pres&shy;ence of my old mas&shy;ter. Sure&shy;ly he must be dead by now. Don’t un&shy;der&shy;es&shy;ti&shy;mate the pow&shy;er of the Force. The Jedi are ex&shy;tinct, their fire has gone out of the uni&shy;verse. You, my friend, are all that’s left of their re&shy;li&shy;gion. Yes. Gov&shy;er&shy;nor Tarkin, we have an emer&shy;gency alert in de&shy;ten&shy;tion block A A-twen&shy;ty-three. The princess! Put all sec&shy;tions on alert!</p>
		<p>Hey… hey, open the pres&shy;sure main&shy;te&shy;nance hatch on unit num&shy;ber... where are we? Three-two-six-eight-two-sev&shy;en. If we can just avoid any more fe&shy;male ad&shy;vice, we ought to be able to get out of here. Well, let’s get mov&shy;ing! Where are you go&shy;ing? No, wait. They’ll hear! Come here, you big cow&shy;ard! Chewie! Come here! Lis&shy;ten. I don’t know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your Wor&shy;ship&shy;ful&shy;ness, let’s get one thing straight! I take or&shy;ders from one per&shy;son! Me! It’s a won&shy;der you’re still alive. Will some&shy;body get this big walk&shy;ing car&shy;pet out of my way? No re&shy;ward is worth this.</p>
